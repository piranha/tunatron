# tunatron

Tunatron is simple and (hopefully) fast application to control iTunes from
keyboard. Actually, not completely control, but just search for/change a track,
that's all it intends to do. Set a global hotkey, and you're good.

Some notes:

 - The interface is not exceptionally pretty, just barely useful - if you want
   to fix that, please contribute (either with ideas what to do or with code).
 - I'm not an experienced Cocoa developer, so if you see ways to improve code,
   they are very welcome (in case of better idiomas or better separation of
   code).

I'm not sure if I forgot anything? Whatever, just try it, if you despise iTunes
slow and inefficient search, or if you like how Foobar search works, or if you
like Textmate/emacs' ido-mode/vim's command-T scatter matching for searching for
files.

TODO:

 - album cover images in separate column
 - playing queue maybe?
