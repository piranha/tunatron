# tunatron

## NOT WORKING AS INTENDED FOR ITUNES 11 :(

Tunatron is simple and (hopefully) fast application to control iTunes from
keyboard. Actually, not completely control, but just search for/change a track,
that's all it intends to do. Set a global hotkey, and you're good.

Some notes:

 - The interface is not exceptionally pretty, just useful - if you want to fix
   that, please contribute (either with ideas what to do or with code).
 - I'm not an experienced Cocoa developer, so if you see ways to improve code,
   suggestions are very welcome (better idiomas, better separation of code,
   etc).

I'm not sure if I forgot anything? Whatever, just try it, if you despise iTunes
slow and inefficient search, or if you like how Foobar2000 search works, or if
you like Textmate/emacs' ido-mode/vim's command-T scatter matching for searching
for files.

Here's how it looks like:

## TODO

 - improve searching (use smarter index/dictionaries, etc)
 - use persistent id: track number to search for a song instead of current
   iteration
 - album cover images in separate column
 - playing queue maybe?
